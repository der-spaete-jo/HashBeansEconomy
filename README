Hash and Beans Economy (ABM)
 - a python 3 implementation

This repository implements an agent-based economic model based on the paper AGENT-BASED COMPUTATIONAL ECONOMICS:A CONSTRUCTIVE APPROACH TO ECONOMIC THEORY by Leigh Tesfatsion (2006).

- switch to the branch "adaptive_pricing" and download as zip 
- unzip 
- to execute "simplest_two_sector_economy.py" open a command prompt (terminal) 
- if python is not defined in PATH (the environment variables), then cd to your python install folder
- type "python path\to\HashBeansEconomy-adaptive_pricing\simplest_two_sector_economy.py"
- a folder containing text/cvs files with the model output "HashBeansEconYYYYMMDDHHMMSS" will be created in your current working directory 
- when matplotlib is available you can invoke more methods of the OutputHandler, especially to print diagrams after the model run is finished
- if you use graphical output the program will not terminate until all windows are closed
