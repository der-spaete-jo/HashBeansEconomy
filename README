Create a class "InputHandler" that provides more functionalities to set inititial parameters. The "init_params.py" defines the same initial values for all agents of a given type (all consumers start with the same relative preference for hash). 
Example use would be that the EconomyController invokes some getInitParamsFor(agent) method of the InputHandler, and saves the returned value in self.init_consumer_data.
